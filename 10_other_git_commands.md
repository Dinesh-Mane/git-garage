# 1. Check Remote Branches Using: `git branch -r`
#### Use Case (Why we do this):
You’re working on a Git project and want to:
- See all the branches that exist on the remote repository (e.g., GitHub)
- Know which remote branches you can pull, track, or switch to
- Coordinate better in a team by knowing what others are working on
- Avoid cluttering your local repo by checking remote branches before fetching/creating

Command:
```bash
git branch -r
```
Example Output:
```bash
origin/main
origin/dev
origin/feature/login
origin/bugfix/api-timeout
```
Then you realize: Oh, the `feature/login` branch exists on the remote! I can check it out locally with:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login origin/feature/login
```
- local branch : `feature/login`
- remote branch : `origin/feature/login`

This creates a local branch (`feature/login`) that tracks the remote one (`origin/feature/login`).
**What it does:**
- Creates a new local branch named `feature/login`
- Sets it to track the remote branch `origin/feature/login`

So any `git pull` or `git push` will know which remote branch to sync with automatically. mhanaje jr me aata tya local branch madhun `git push` kelo tr remote vachya `origin/feature/login` branch vr jayil. similarly jr me local branch madhun jr `git pull` kelo tr te remote walya `origin/feature/login` branch madhun changes uchalun aanel.

# 2. Check which local branch is tracking to which remote branch: `git branch -vv`
Command:
```bash
git branch -vv
```
This command lists all local branches, and shows:
- Whether each branch is checked out
- Which remote branch (if any) it's tracking
- The latest commit hash
- The commit message for that branch

Example Output:
```bash
* main                9a3c0d1 [origin/main]     chore: update README formatting
  dev                 b7c8214 [origin/dev]      feat: add login form validation
  feature/login       4d1e456 [origin/feature/login: ahead 1] fix: correct login redirect bug
  old-feature         a5b4d9c                    legacy: old prototype
```
1. `* main 9a3c0d1 [origin/main] chore: update README formatting`

| Part                              | Meaning                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `*`                               | ✅ This is your **current active branch**                  |
| `main`                            | Your **local branch name**                                |
| `9a3c0d1`                         | The **short SHA** of the latest commit on this branch     |
| `[origin/main]`                   | This branch is **tracking** `origin/main` (remote branch) |
| `chore: update README formatting` | The **latest commit message** on this branch              |

2. `dev b7c8214 [origin/dev] feat: add login form validation`

| Part                              | Meaning                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`                             | Your **local branch name**                                 |
| `b7c8214`                         | The **short SHA** of the latest commit on this branch      |
| `[origin/dev]`                    | This branch is **tracking** `origin/dev` (a remote branch) |
| `feat: add login form validation` | The **latest commit message** on this branch               |


3. `feature/login 4d1e456 [origin/feature/login: ahead 1] fix: correct login redirect bug`

| Extra Info: ahead 1 |

This means: Your local branch has 1 commit not yet pushed to `origin/feature/login`.  

So you need to run to sync your remote branch:
```bash
git push origin feature/login
```
> **To view differences between local and remote:** `git log origin/feature/login..feature/login`  
> This shows the commits that are in your local branch but not yet in the remote.  


4. `old-feature a5b4d9c legacy: old prototype`

- This branch is not tracking any remote branch
- No `[origin/xxx]` shown
- Meaning: It is local-only (maybe from an old project or orphaned)

---

# 3. Setting Upstream Branch 
#### Use Case: Why do this?
You created a local branch (e.g., `main`, `dev`, or `feature/login`) and pushed it to the remote, but Git doesn’t know which remote branch it should sync with when you run: `git pull` or `git push`  
So you must manually link ("track") your local branch with the remote one using:
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<remote-branch> <local-branch> 
```
example;
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
```
This says: “Git, please make my local main branch track the remote branch origin/main.”  
> `origin/main` mhanje remote repo madhe present asleli main branch

#### What is “upstream”?
The upstream is the remote branch that your local branch will track.  
This allows Git to understand where to pull from or push to by default, without needing to mention the full remote branch name every time.  

Without Upstream Set: You’ll see this kind of error:
```bash
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main
```
Or when pulling:
```bash
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
```

#### After this is set:
You can now simply run:
- `git pull` → It knows to pull from origin/main
- `git push` → It knows to push to origin/main

You don’t need to specify remote + branch name every time.

#### Example Flow:
```bash
# 1. Create a new branch locally
git checkout -b dev

# 2. Push it for the first time (without tracking)
git push origin dev

# 3. Git doesn't know what dev should track (try a pull and you'll get an error)

# 4. So manually link (track) it:
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev

# 5. Now you can just:
git pull    # ← pulls from origin/dev
git push    # ← pushes to origin/dev
```

You can verify tracking setup via:
```bash
git status
```
You’ll now see:
```bash
On branch dev
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/dev'.
```
Or use:
```bash
git branch -vv
```
You’ll get something like:
```arduino
* dev   7e3a91f [origin/dev] feat: setup auth routes
```

## But wait, we have a shortcut to set upstream branch directly while pushing for the first time 
If you're pushing a branch for the first time and want to set upstream in one command, use:
```bash
git push -u origin <branch>                            # if local branch name is same as remote branch name (eg. 'dev')
git push -u origin <local_branch>:<remote_branch>      # if local branch and remote branch name are different  (eg. local:'dev' & remote: ``)
```
Example:
```bash
git push -u origin dev
#OR
git push -u origin dev:staging
```
This `git push -u origin dev` command does two things at once:  
1. Pushes your local `dev` branch to the remote (`origin/dev`)
2. Sets up a tracking relationship (upstream) between your local `dev` and remote `origin/dev`

This is the same as:
```bash
git push origin dev
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev
```

After `git push -u origin dev`, you can simply use:
```bash
git pull   # Will now pull from origin/dev
git push   # Will now push to origin/dev
```
OR  
After `git push -u origin dev:staging`, you can simply use:
```bash
git push     # pushes dev → staging
git pull     # pulls staging → dev
```
Confirm with: `git branch -vv`

| Branch | Commit  | Upstream Info      | Commit Msg                 |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `dev`  | abc1234 | `[origin/staging]` | feat: add login validation |

If You Just Run any one of the following command:
```bash
git push origin dev
git push origin dev:staging
```
It will push, But it won’t set upstream tracking unless you add `-u`.  
So you'd need to set it manually:
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/staging dev
```
Recommended Shortcut (Push + Track):
```bash
git push -u origin dev:staging
```

---

# 4. Push All Branches to Remote - Not recomended at all
You’re working on a project where:
- You’ve created multiple local branches (`main`, `feature/login`, `bugfix/payment`, etc.)
- You want to back them up or share them all with the remote repository (usually origin) in one go.

Command
```bash
git push --all origin
```
This command pushes all your local branches to the origin remote repo in one command.

#### Example
Let’s say you run:
```bash
git branch
```
Output:
```bash
* main
  feature/login
  bugfix/payment
  experimental-api
```
Running:
```bash
git push --all origin
```
Will push:
- `main` → `origin/main`
- `feature/login` → `origin/feature/login`
- `bugfix/payment` → `origin/bugfix/payment`
- `experimental-api` → `origin/experimental-api`

⚠️ Even if some of these branches are not finished, not meant to be shared, or still buggy, Git will still push them all.
> if any branch with same name is missing on remote then it will create that new branch on remote automatically.

Explanation: What This Command Does Internally
| Step | Action                                                               |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ 1  | Iterates over **all local branches** you’ve created                  |
| ✅ 2  | Attempts to **create/update the corresponding branches** on `origin` |
| ✅ 3  | Pushes each branch’s commit history to `origin`                      |
| ⚠️ 4 | No filtering — **all branches go**, even half-baked ones             |

---

# 5. Push Tags to Remote
**Use Case:** You’ve created Git tags locally (like `v1.0.0`, `release-2025-Q1`, etc.) to mark important points in the repo’s history — for example:
- Product releases
- Deployment snapshots
- Version tracking
- Milestone commits

Now, you want to share those tags with your team or your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) that respond to tags.

#### What is a Tag in Git?
In Git, a tag is like a named pointer to a commit.

For example:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
```
This creates a tag on the latest commit (HEAD). You can also tag older commits.  
It helps you say: "This commit was version 1.0.0 of our app!"  

Command
```bash
git push origin --tags
```
This tells Git to: “Push all tags you’ve created locally to the remote named origin.”

#### Why We Do This?

| Purpose           | Why Tags Are Important                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
|  CI/CD         | Some pipelines **trigger deployments** from tags |
| Testing Builds | Easy to reproduce the state of code at a tag     |
| Versioning    | Tags act as clean **version markers**            |
| Rollbacks      | You can reset your repo to a tag anytime         |
| Collaboration  | Team knows exactly which commit was released     |

Example Workflow:
```bash
# 1. Create a tag after finalizing a release commit
git tag v1.0.0

# 2. Push code changes as usual
git push origin main

# 3. Push the tag
git push origin --tags
```
Output Example:
```bash
Enumerating objects: 1, done.
Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
Writing objects: 100% (1/1), 177 bytes | 177.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To github.com:user/project.git
 * [new tag]         v1.0.0 -> v1.0.0
```
Now, `v1.0.0` is available on GitHub → your team and deployment systems can see it.

**Caution**
- `git push origin --tags` will push all local tags — even ones you didn’t mean to publish.
- Best practice: Push tags only after validating them, or push one tag at a time:

```bash
git push origin v1.0.0
```

# 6. Clone via SSH Instead of HTTPS

When you clone a GitHub repo via HTTPS, Git will ask you for:
- Your GitHub username
- Your Personal Access Token (PAT) as password (since passwords are deprecated)

And it does this every time you:
- Push
- Pull
- Fetch

That gets annoying and inefficient, especially for frequent Git users or automation.

Instead, we use SSH to:
- Avoid typing credentials again and again
- Securely authenticate using cryptographic keys
- Make automation, scripting, and CI/CD easier

SSH Clone Command
```bash
git clone git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
```
This means: “Clone the repo myrepo from the user user, using SSH authentication.”

#### How Does SSH Work in Git?
Instead of username/password or token, Git uses SSH keys, which are a pair of files:
| File Type      | Location                | Purpose                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Private Key | `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`     | Stays **on your machine**                    |
| 🔓 Public Key  | `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` | Gets uploaded to **GitHub → Settings → SSH** |

GitHub stores your public key, and Git uses your private key silently to verify who you are. You don’t need to type anything again.

## Step-by-Step Setup: SSH for GitHub
#### Step 1: Generate SSH Key
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
```
| Option       | Meaning                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-t ed25519` | Use **Ed25519 algorithm** (faster/safer) |
| `-C`         | Add comment to key (your email/identity) |

You'll be prompted:
```bash
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```
Press Enter to accept default.

#### Step 2: Add Key to SSH Agent (so it loads in memory)
```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### Step 3: Add Your Public Key to GitHub
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
Copy the output (starts with `ssh-ed25519 ...`)  
Go to: **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH Key**  
Paste it there.  

#### Step 4: Clone Repo via SSH
```bash
git clone git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
```
Now Git will: 
- Use SSH
- Never ask you for username/password again
- Use your private key silently behind the scenes

## Example: SSH vs HTTPS Flow
#### HTTPS Example
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/myrepo.git
```
Then every time you push:
```makefile
Username: your-github-username
Password: your personal access token
```
#### SSH Example
```bash
git clone git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
```
➡️ Then every time you push:
✅ Git uses the SSH key silently
✅ No prompts
✅ Smooth experience

#### Summary 
| Part                 | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| What it is           | Cloning a repo using SSH instead of HTTPS           |
| Why use it           | Avoid manual auth, speed up workflow, secure access |
| Requirements         | SSH key pair + GitHub public key added              |
| Benefit              | No need for username/token on every push/pull       |
| Automation friendly? | ✅ Yes — great for scripts, CI/CD, or GitHub Actions |

#### Common Mistakes
| Mistake                      | Fix                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH key not added to GitHub  | Add `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to GitHub SSH settings        |
| SSH agent not running        | Run `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` |
| Cloning via HTTPS by mistake | Use the correct SSH URL from GitHub repo: `git@...`       |

---

# 7. Change Remote Repo URL (HTTPS → SSH or vice versa)
Let’s say you:
- Cloned a GitHub repository using HTTPS, like this:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/myrepo.git
```
- But now you’re tired of typing username/token every time you push or pull.

So, you want to switch to using SSH, which is faster, secure, and doesn’t require repeated login prompts.

Command to Change Remote URL
```bash
git remote set-url origin <new_url>
```
This command updates the origin remote of your local repository to use a new URL (either HTTPS or SSH).

Example: Switching from HTTPS to SSH
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
```

#### Why Change the URL?
| Problem      | HTTPS Flow                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Push or Pull | 🔐 GitHub prompts you for **username and PAT** (Personal Access Token) every time |
| Security     | PATs expire or need rotation                                                      |
| Annoying     | Re-authentication slows you down                                                  |
| Automation   | Not ideal for CI/CD or scripts                                                    |

#### SH Flow (After Changing URL):
```bash
git push origin main
```
- No username/password prompts
- Git uses your private SSH key behind the scenes
- Faster and automated-friendly (great for CI/CD)

#### How to Check Remote URL (Before and After)
Before:
```bash
git remote -v
```
Output:
```perl
origin  https://github.com/user/myrepo.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/user/myrepo.git (push)
```

After:
```bash
git remote -v
```
Output:
```sql
origin  git@github.com:user/myrepo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:user/myrepo.git (push)
```

#### Bonus: Switch Back to HTTPS
If you ever want to switch back to HTTPS, run:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/myrepo.git
```

# 8. Sync Fork with Upstream Remote
You have forked an open-source project (or any repo) to make contributions.  
Over time, the original repository (often called the "upstream") gets updated with new changes (commits from other contributors). But your fork becomes outdated.  
To keep your fork up to date with the original repo (and avoid conflicts or working on outdated code), you sync it with the upstream repository.  

#### What’s Happening Conceptually
| Repo Type  | Description                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `origin`   | Your **forked repo** on GitHub (the one you cloned) |
| `upstream` | The **original repo** from which you forked         |

## Step-by-Step Commands 

#### Step 1: Add the Upstream Remote
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git
```
**What this does:**
- Adds a new remote named upstream to your local git config.
- This remote points to the original repository (not your fork).

**You only do this once per repo.**

Verify Remote Setup
```bash
git remote -v
```
Example output:
```perl
origin    https://github.com/yourusername/your-fork.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/yourusername/your-fork.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/original/repo.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/original/repo.git (push)
```

#### Step 2: Fetch from Upstream
```bash
git fetch upstream
```
**What this does:**
- Fetches all branches and updates from the upstream repository.
- It does NOT affect your working directory or merge anything yet.
- It just brings the commits into your local `.git` data store.

You can now refer to upstream branches like `upstream/main`.

#### Step 3 (Option 1): Merge the Updates
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```
**What this does:**
- Merges upstream/main into your currently checked-out branch (like your main).
- A merge commit is created if there are any changes.

**Safe and preserves history, but can result in extra merge commits.**

#### Step 3 (Option 2): Rebase Your Branch
```bash
git rebase upstream/main
```
**What this does:**
- Re-applies your commits on top of upstream/main.
- The result is a linear history, as if your commits were made after the latest upstream changes.

**Cleaner history, but more complex in case of conflicts.**

#### Example Scenario
Imagine:
- You forked a repo called `awesome-lib` months ago.
- The upstream added 20 commits in `main` branch.
- You want to make a new PR, but your main is outdated.

So you do:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/awesome-org/awesome-lib.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
# OR
git rebase upstream/main
```
Your fork is now fully up to date, and ready for clean contributions.

#### Tip: Push Updates(local branch) to Your GitHub Fork
After merge or rebase:
```bash
git push origin main
```
Otherwise your GitHub fork stays outdated.

## Summary Table
| Command                         | What It Does                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git remote add upstream <url>` | Adds original repo as `upstream` remote                            |
| `git fetch upstream`            | Fetches updates from upstream                                      |
| `git merge upstream/main`       | Merges upstream changes into your local branch (preserves history) |
| `git rebase upstream/main`      | Re-applies your changes after upstream changes (linear history)    |
| `git push origin main`          | Pushes the updated local branch to your GitHub fork                |

# 9. Delete Remote Branch
You’ve been working on a feature or bugfix in a dedicated branch, for example: feature-old.  
You merged it into main (or maybe the feature was abandoned), and now:
- The branch is no longer needed on GitHub.
- You want to keep the remote clean and organized.
- You want to prevent confusion among teammates or contributors.

Command to Delete a Remote Branch
```bash
git push origin --delete <branch_name>
```
Example:
```bash
git push origin --delete feature-old
```

#### What This Command Actually Does:
When you run this:
```bash
git push origin --delete feature-old
```
You’re sending a delete instruction to the origin remote (usually GitHub) telling it to remove the feature-old branch from the remote repository.

It’s equivalent to:
```bash
git push origin :feature-old
```
Both achieve the same result: deleting the branch from the remote.

#### What Happens After Deleting?
**On GitHub UI:**  
- The feature-old branch disappears from the remote branch list.
- If a PR was opened from this branch, GitHub will mark it as closed (if not merged yet).
- If already merged, no issues occur.

**On Local Machine:**  
The branch still exists unless you delete it manually with:
```bash
git branch -d feature-old
```
So remote and local branches are independent at this point.

#### Tip: Delete a Branch Only After It’s Merged
Deleting an unmerged branch removes all its changes from the remote history.

To check merge status:
```bash
git branch --merged main
```
If the branch shows up here, it’s safe to delete.

Danger Zone: If the branch was not merged, deleting it from the remote will make it inaccessible to others unless someone has a local copy.  
So always double-check before deleting unmerged branches.

| Task                               | Command                                |

# 10. Check Remote Info with `git remote show origin`
You're working with a remote Git repository (e.g., on GitHub), and you want to:
- Inspect remote URL configuration (SSH/HTTPS)
- See which branch is the main (HEAD) on the remote
- Check which remote branches are tracked locally
- Confirm if your local branches are properly tracking the right remote branches
- Debug issues when pushing or pulling doesn't behave as expected

Command:
```bash
git remote show origin
```
Example Output:
```bash
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
  HEAD branch: main
  Remote branches:
    dev                tracked
    feature/login      tracked
    main               tracked
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    dev            merges with remote dev
    main           merges with remote main
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    dev            pushes to dev (up to date)
    main           pushes to main (fast-forwardable)
```

| Part                                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `* remote origin`                          | `origin` is the **default name** for the remote repository you cloned or added.                                                                 |
| `Fetch URL`                                | This is the **URL used when you do `git fetch` or `git pull`**. Can be HTTPS or SSH.                                                            |
| `Push URL`                                 | This is the **URL used when you do `git push`**. Often same as Fetch URL, unless you configured it differently.                                 |
| `HEAD branch: main`                        | This tells you that `main` is the **default branch** on the remote (`HEAD`) — usually what PRs go into by default.                              |
| `Remote branches:`                         | These are all the **branches available on the remote** (like GitHub), and whether your local Git is "tracking" them.                            |
| `tracked`                                  | Indicates your Git is **tracking changes** to this branch from the remote (via fetch/pull).                                                     |
| `Local branches configured for 'git pull'` | Shows which of your **local branches** are linked to pull from which **remote branches**.                                                       |
| `Local refs configured for 'git push'`     | Shows how your **local branches** will be pushed to the remote. Also tells you if the branch is up to date, needs pushing, or can fast-forward. |

## Typical Use Cases in Real Workflows:
#### 1. Sync Issue Debugging
You're on a local branch dev and pull fails. You check:
```bash
git remote show origin
```
And realize:
```nginx
Local branches configured for 'git pull':
  (no entry for dev)
```
Meaning: You never set an upstream. Solution:
```bash
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/dev dev
```
2. Changing from HTTPS to SSH
You're asked to push but Git keeps prompting for a username/token:
```bash
git remote show origin
```
Shows:
```sql
Fetch URL: https://github.com/user/myrepo.git
```
Switch to SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/myrepo.git
```
3. Checking Team Branches
You want to know what branches exist on GitHub before switching or deleting:
```bash
git remote show origin
```
Shows:
```bash
Remote branches:
  main
  dev
  feature/login
```

#### Tip: View Remotes Summary
To simply list all remotes and their URLs:
```bash
git remote -v
```
Example:
```sql
origin  git@github.com:user/myrepo.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:user/myrepo.git (push)
```

# 11. Force Push to Remote `git push --force origin <branch>`
**You're typically using `git push --force` when:**  
- You have rewritten commit history using:
  - `git rebase`
  - `git commit --amend`
  - `git reset` (soft, mixed, or hard)

- You want to replace the remote branch history with your local history, even if the remote history is different.

#### What You’ll Achieve:
The remote branch will match your local branch exactly — all commits, messages, history.  
Useful in personal repositories, or if you are working alone on a feature branch.  

#### How It Works Internally:
Normally, Git refuses to push changes if the history is rewritten — to protect you from losing data.
```bash
# Without force:
git push origin feature/login
# Git checks:
# -> Is my local feature/login a fast-forward of remote feature/login?
# If not — it blocks the push to prevent history overwrite.
```
But if you run:
```bash
git push --force origin feature/login
```
You're telling Git: “Ignore the fact that the remote has a different history. I want to overwrite it anyway.”  
This replaces the remote's feature/login history with your local branch's history.  

#### Why It’s Dangerous:
| Risk                              | Description                                                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Overwrites teammates' work**  | If someone else pushed commits to the branch that you don't have, they will be deleted from the remote. |
| ❌ **Irreversible without backup** | Once pushed, remote history is gone unless someone else has a copy locally.                             |
| ❌ **Breaks collaboration**        | Others working on the same branch may see confusing errors and may need to hard reset.                  |
| ❌ **Triggers force pull**         | Others must use `git fetch` + `git reset` to sync with new history — dangerous if not done carefully.   |

#### xample Scenario
You Did This:
```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# You change 3 commit messages and order

git push origin feature/login
# Git says: rejected — non-fast-forward
```
So You Run:
```bash
git push --force origin feature/login
```
🟢 Now: The remote branch matches your local one exactly, with updated commits.
🔴 But: If a teammate had added a commit before your force push, that commit is gone from the remote.

#### When Is It Okay to Use?
| Situation                                | Is `--force` Okay?                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Personal repo / solo project             | ✅ Yes                                 |
| Feature branch no one else is working on | ✅ Yes                                 |
| Team repo shared branch (`main`, `dev`)  | ❌ Never use without full coordination |
| CI/CD or automated rebase scripts        | ⚠️ Use `--force-with-lease` instead   |

#### Safer Alternative: Use `--force-with-lease`
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/login
```
This only forces the push if no one else has pushed since your last pull/fetch — safer in teams

---

# 12. Push Only If Remote Has No Conflicts (Safe Force Push)
Suppose you're working on a feature branch (`feature/login`) and you have rewritten its history — maybe by:  
- Using `git rebase`
- Squashing commits
- Amending commits with `git commit --amend`

Now, you want to push this changed history to the remote branch.  
But if your teammate has pushed something to the same remote branch in the meantime, a `--force` push will overwrite their changes —> data loss!  

> Using git push --force will blindly overwrite remote history, even if new commits exist on the remote that you don’t have locally.

**Solution:** Use `--force-with-lease` instead.  

Command:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
#### xplanation: What Happens Internally?
| Behavior             | Detail                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--force`            | Pushes changes even if your local history rewrites and will overwrite someone else's changes — no questions asked. Dangerous in teams.           |
| `--force-with-lease` | Adds a safety check: it will push only **if the remote branch is exactly how it was the last time you fetched/pulled it**.                       |
| Lease = Contract     | You’re saying: “I promise I saw the latest state of the remote when I last synced, and I want to update it only **if it hasn’t changed** since.” |
| Remote changed?      | If someone pushed new commits in the meantime, the command **fails**. You can then investigate or pull first.                                    |

## Step-by-Step Real-World Scenario
1. You’re on branch `feature/login`
2. You do a rebase:
```bash
git rebase -i main
```
3. You’re ready to push updated history:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
Now:
1. If no one else pushed to origin/feature/login after your last pull/fetch → your push succeeds.  
2. If someone else pushed to origin/feature/login → Git blocks the push and says:  

```bash
! [rejected]        feature/login -> feature/login (stale info)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:user/repo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
```

| Force Type           | Behavior                                          | Safety           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `--force`            | Overwrites **regardless** of what’s on the remote | ❌ Dangerous      |
| `--force-with-lease` | Overwrites **only if** remote hasn't changed      | ✅ Safe for teams |

#### Example Setup to Test:
```bash
# Two users cloning the same repo
# User A and User B both clone and checkout 'feature/login'

# User A
git checkout feature/login
echo "User A changes" >> file.txt
git commit -am "User A edit"
git push

# User B (on same branch)
git rebase -i HEAD~2  # or amend something
git push --force-with-lease
```
If B hasn't fetched A’s latest push, B's push will fail — avoiding overwriting A’s commit.

#### Bonus: What to Do If the Push Fails?
Run:
```bash
git fetch origin
```
Inspect what changed:
```bash
git log HEAD..origin/feature/login
```
Rebase again if needed:
```bash
git rebase origin/feature/login
```
Now try pushing again:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
