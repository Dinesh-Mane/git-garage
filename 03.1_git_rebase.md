# `git rebase`
**Purpose:** Apply commits from one branch onto another to create a cleaner linear history (without merge commits).  
**Syntax:**  
```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git rebase main
```
**Example:**
```bash
# Assume you're on `feature-1`
git rebase main
```
> This reapplies your `feature-1` commits on top of the latest `main`  
> Use case: Avoid merge commits in a cleaner project history

### Scenario:
You have this situation:
```mathematica
main:        A---B---C
               \
feature-1:      D---E
```
You want to move `D` and `E` on top of `C`, making it:
```mathematica
main:        A---B---C
                        \
feature-1 (rebased):     D'--E'
```
Commands:
```bash
# Start on your feature branch
git checkout feature-1

# Rebase onto latest main
git rebase main
```
Output:
```bash
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/feature-1.
```
You can now `git push --force` if it's already pushed.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. Git identifies the common ancestor of feature and main, which is C.
2. It finds the commits on feature that are not in main — here, D and E.
3. It temporarily saves those commits as patches:
   - Patch D = changes made in D
   - Patch E = changes made in E
4. It resets feature to main’s HEAD (commit C):

```mathematica
HEAD → feature → C
```
5. It reapplies Patch D on top of C → new commit D'
6. It then applies Patch E → new commit E'


## Let’s break down what Git does internally, stage by stage:
#### 1. Identify the merge-base
Git finds the most recent common ancestor of the branches you're rebasing: 
```bash
git merge-base feature-1 main
```
This will return commit A, because it's the point from which both branches diverged.
So:
- Main: A → B → C
- Feature: A → D → E

**Merge Base = A**
#### 2. List commits to be replayed
Git figures out what new commits exist on `feature-1` after `A`, that are not on `main`.
```bash
Commits to replay = [D, E]
```
Git internally prepares the patch(diff) from A to D and D to E.

#### 3. Checkout the `main` branch’s tip commit (`C`) internally
Although you're still on `feature-1`, Git detaches HEAD and sets it temporarily to `C` so that it can reapply commits on top of it.
```bash
HEAD → C
```
Your working directory now reflects the state of the code at commit C.

#### 4. Apply patch from D onto C → creates new commit D′
Git takes the diff of what D changed compared to A, and tries to apply that change onto C (the new base).  
If no conflicts:
- Creates a new commit D′:
  - Parent = C
  - Same commit message as D
  - Different hash (because parent is different)
- Updates the tree and index to reflect this

Internally stored as a new commit object in .git/objects.

#### 5. Apply patch from E onto D′ → creates new commit E′
Same as above:
- Diff from D to E is applied to the new base (D′)
- New commit E′ created with parent D′

So now the new history becomes:
```mathematica
main:        A---B---C
                          \
feature-1:                 D′--E′
```

#### 6. Update the feature-1 branch reference
Git moves the pointer of `feature-1` from `E` to `E′`
So:
- `feature-1 → E′`
- HEAD is still on `feature-1`

At this point, the old commits (D, E) still exist in `.git/objects`, but are orphaned — they are not referenced by any branch.

#### 7. If already pushed, force push is required
Because you rewrote commit history (D, E → D′, E′), if you had already pushed `feature-1` to a remote, then you need:
```bash
git push --force
```
Otherwise the remote will reject the push because the history diverges

#### If There Are Conflicts
Git stops the rebase:

```bash
error: conflict in file.txt
You fix the file, then:
```
```bash
git add file.txt
git rebase --continue
```
**If you want to stop rebase:**
```bash
git rebase --abort
```
